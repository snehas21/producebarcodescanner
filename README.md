# ProduceScan

A single-page web app that scans barcodes and PLU stickers on fruits &amp;
vegetables (like apples) and shows details about them - built with Canadian
grocery shopping in mind.

## What it does

- **Camera scanning**: uses your device camera (via
  [html5-qrcode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode)) to read both
  1D barcodes (UPC-A/EAN-13, used on packaged produce) and PLU sticker codes.
- **PLU lookup**: loose produce (like a Gala apple) is usually identified by a
  4-5 digit PLU sticker rather than a scannable barcode, so there's also a
  manual entry box. `plu-data.js` has a small, hand-checked reference table
  covering common Canadian grocery items (many apple varieties, plus common
  fruits & veg), and the app explains what the code format itself means:
  - **4 digits** → conventionally grown
  - **5 digits starting with 9** → certified organic
  - **5 digits starting with 8** → legacy "bioengineered" flag (optional
    since ~2015, so its absence doesn't mean non-GMO)
- **Barcode lookup**: for packaged items (e.g. a bag of apples with a real
  UPC/EAN barcode), the app queries the free, crowd-sourced
  [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) API for product name,
  brand, quantity, ingredients, nutrition (kcal/sugar/fibre per 100g), and any
  notable certifications on file (organic, fair trade, Non-GMO Project
  Verified, etc.).
- **Pesticide-residue context**: PLU entries can be tagged with EWG's 2026
  "Dirty Dozen" / "Clean Fifteen" Shopper's Guide to Pesticides - a published,
  commodity-level ranking of which conventionally-grown produce types most/
  least often test positive for residue in US sampling. Shown as a reference
  note, not a lab result for the specific item scanned.
- **Search by name**: type a produce name (e.g. "honeycrisp") to find its PLU
  code without scanning.
- **Scan history**: recent lookups are kept in `localStorage` for quick
  re-viewing.

## Running it

It's a static site - just serve the folder and open it in a browser:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`. Camera access requires HTTPS (or
`localhost`), so for real device testing, deploy it (e.g. GitHub Pages) or
use a tool like `ngrok`.

## Accuracy notes

- The PLU reference data in `plu-data.js` is a curated **sample**, not the
  full official IFPS PLU list (1000+ codes, and it changes over time).
  Codes can also vary by region, size grade, or grower. Treat matches as a
  helpful reference, not a guarantee.
- In Canada, produce labelled "organic" must be certified under the Canada
  Organic Regime (CFIA) - look for the Canada Organic logo to confirm.

## Files

- `index.html` - markup, styles, and the camera reader container
- `app.js` - scanning, code classification, lookups, and rendering
- `plu-data.js` - the local PLU reference table
